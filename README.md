# module-one-challenge
Repo for the Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to edit a codebase so that it followed accessibility standards. In turn, this optimizes the website for search engines. To do this,distinct semantic HTML elements were added to replace the generic semantic elements. By creating a logical structure within the codebase, it is immediately more readable and accessible, not only to fellow developers, but also within the codebase itself. By exchanging general semantic elements with more consise semantic elements, the CSS sheet can be more succinct by calling on more specific elements within the codebase. To futher increase accessibility, image alt tags were created as image descriptors within the codebase. Through this project, I was able to learn to learn more about the links between the CSS sheet and HTML index and was able to practice debugging after adding semantic HTML elements and condensing the CSS sheet.
