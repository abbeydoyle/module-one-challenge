Repo for the Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to edit a codebase so that it followed accessibility standards. In turn, this optimizes the website for search engines. To do this, semantic HTML elements were added to replace the generic "<div></div>" elements. By creating a logical structure within the codebase, it is immediately more readable and accessible, not only to fellow developers, but also within the codebase itself. By exchanging "<div></div>" elements with more consise semantic elements, the CSS sheet can be more succinct by calling on more specific elements within the codebase. To futher increase accessibility, image alt tags were created as image descriptors within the codebase. Through this project, I was able to learn to learn more about the links between the CSS sheet and HTML index and was able to practice debugging after adding semantic HTML elements and condensing the CSS sheet. 

<!-- 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
 -->

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

I received advice on this challenge from my tutor, Rene Trevino.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
