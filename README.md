Repo for the Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to edit a codebase so that it followed accessibility standards. In turn, this optimizes the website for search engines. To do this, semantic HTML elements were added to replace the generic "<div></div>" elements. By creating a logical structure within the codebase, it is immediately more readable and accessible, not only to fellow developers, but also within the codebase itself. By exchanging "<div></div>" elements with more consise semantic elements, the CSS sheet can be more succinct by calling on more specific elements within the codebase. To futher increase accessibility, image alt tags were created as image descriptors within the codebase. Through this project, I was able to learn to learn more about the links between the CSS sheet and HTML index and was able to practice debugging after adding semantic HTML elements and condensing the CSS sheet. 

<!-- 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
 -->

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
